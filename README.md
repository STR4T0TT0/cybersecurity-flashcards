## Instructions

Each flashcard contains a question or prompt on the front and an answer or explanation on the back. These flashcards can be utilized in three ways:

1. **Self-Study:** Review the flashcards regularly to reinforce your understanding.

2. **Quizzes:** Test your knowledge by attempting to answer the questions before flipping the card.

3. **Group Study:** Use the flashcards in study groups to facilitate discussions and learning.

### Anki

Anki is a powerful flashcard app that uses spaced repetition to help you retain information more effectively. To use these flashcards with Anki:

1. **Download Anki:** If you haven't already, download the Anki app from [Anki's official website](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

2. **Import Flashcards:**
   - We provide `.apkg` files, which are Anki packages containing the flashcards. You can download these files from the `Anki_Flashcards` directory in this repository.
   - Open Anki and click on `File` > `Import`.
   - Select the downloaded `.apkg` file and import it into Anki.
   
3. **Review Flashcards:** Anki will schedule the flashcards for review based on your learning progress. Be sure to review them regularly to take advantage of the spaced repetition system.
   
4. **Sync Across Devices:** if you want to study on multiple devices, create an AnkiWeb account and sync your flashcards. This allows you to review your cards on mobile devices and other computers.
